# Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

<h3>Introduction</h3>
This project aims to develop a scalable customer segmentation system using RFM
(Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis and K-Means clustering, leveraging open
transactional datasets. Customer segmentation is a crucial task in marketing analytics
that helps businesses identify customer behavior patterns and target them effectively. By
utilizing RFM metrics ( Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value ), we can group
customers into meaningful segments based on their purchase behavior. The project will
address challenges such as handling large datasets, scaling computations across
distributed platforms, and ensuring interpretability of clustering results.


<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>To solve the problem, we will use the following methods</p>
<p>1. Data Collection: Using open datasets from Kaggle - Online Retail Data Set (
dataset contains all purchases made for an online retail company based in the
UK during an eight month period )</p>
<p>2. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and deriving RFM
metrics (Recency, Frequency, and Monetary value).</p>
<p>3. Feature Engineering: Normalizing and preparing RFM features for clustering.</p>
<p>4. K-Means Clustering: Implementing distributed K-Means clustering using
platforms like Apache Spark to segment customers.</p>
<p>5. Evaluation: Analyzing cluster quality using metrics like Silhouette Score and
Davies-Bouldin Index and interpreting the clusters for marketing strategies.</p>
